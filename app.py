Step 1: Language Processing Rule

First, estimate the language distribution in the image and follow the corresponding instruction:

Scenario A: The document contains a significant amount of English text (i.e., English makes up more than 10% of the content).

Action: Extract only the English content. Completely ignore and discard all non-English text.

Scenario B: The document is overwhelmingly non-English (i.e., 90% or more of the text is in a non-English language).

Action: Translate the entire document into English. Any isolated English words should be kept and included in their logical place within the final translated output.

Step 2: Output Rule

Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or preambles in your response. Begin the response directly with the extracted or translated content.

Step 3: Formatting Instructions

After processing the language according to the rule above, format the entire output using these guidelines:

Markdown Output: The entire response must be in Markdown. This includes all text, headings, tables, and lists.

Tables:
-- Recreate all tables as proper Markdown tables.
-- If you are following Scenario A, ensure the tables are built using only the English headers and data columns.

Preserve original emphasis like bold and italics. Preserve paragraphs.

Footnotes:
-- If a table has footnotes, place the full footnote text immediately below its corresponding table.
-- In the table cell, mark the reference number with a tilde, like this: 1,234,567~1~.
-- Begin the footnote text itself with the same marker, like this: ~1~ This is the footnote text.

Completeness: Ensure all extracted (or translated) text, including any URLs, is present in the final output.""")

**Instructions:**
1.  Your primary task is to define the word provided in the "WORD TO DEFINE" field. You must only define this word.
2.  Use the "CONTEXT SENTENCE" field only to understand the word's meaning. Do not define other words from the context.
3.  Write at a 4th-7th grade reading level. Keep sentences short and use everyday language.
4.  If the word is a common grammatical word (like 'with', 'the', 'a', 'is', 'of'), explain the job it does in the sentence instead of giving a dictionary definition.
5.  For all other words, first give a simple, one-sentence definition. Then, explain its meaning using the context. If no context is given, provide a simple, adult-oriented example sentence.

**Examples:**

---
**Input:**
WORD TO DEFINE:
Liable
CONTEXT SENTENCE:
The tenant is liable for any damage caused to the property.

**Output:**
Liable means you are legally responsible for something. In this sentence, it means the person renting the apartment must pay for anything they break.
---
**Input:**
WORD TO DEFINE:
with
CONTEXT SENTENCE:
They arrived with shouts.

**Output:**
'With' is a word that connects things together. In this sentence, its job is to show that the people ('they') and the 'shouts' arrived at the same time.
---
**Input:**
WORD TO DEFINE:
Mandatory
CONTEXT SENTENCE:

**Output:**
Mandatory means something is required and you have to do it; it is not a choice. For example, it is mandatory to have a driver's license to drive a car.
---
**Input:**
WORD TO DEFINE:
Accrue
CONTEXT SENTENCE:
The interest on your savings account will accrue monthly.

**Output:**
Accrue means to build up or be added over time. In this context, it means the extra money from interest is added to your savings account each month, helping it grow.
