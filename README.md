   - Optimize images for better OCR accuracy (resize, compress, sharpen)
   - Process multi-page PDFs directly without conversion
   - Extract and format text while preserving document structure
3. **Read Interactively**: 
   - Use the speech controls to listen to the text with synchronized word highlighting
   - Double-click on any word to get contextual, accessible definitions
   - Pause, resume, or stop reading at any time

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON environment variable not set"**
   - Ensure your `.env` file is in the project root
   - Verify the JSON content is properly formatted as a single line string
   - Check that `python-dotenv` is installed

2. **"Permission denied" errors with Google Cloud**
   - Verify your service account has the "Vertex AI User" role
   - Ensure the Vertex AI API is enabled in your Google Cloud project
   - Check that your project ID matches the one in the service account

3. **Text-to-speech not working**
   - Check browser permissions for speech synthesis
   - Try a different browser (Chrome/Edge recommended)
   - Ensure system volume is enabled

4. **Application won't start**
   - Check that port 5000 isn't already in use
   - Set a different port using the `PORT` environment variable
   - Verify all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

5. **Image processing errors**
   - System falls back to original image if optimization fails
   - Check that Pillow and pillow-heif are properly installed
   - For HEIC files, ensure pillow-heif is compatible with your system

6. **PDF upload issues**
   - Ensure your browser supports the HTML5 file API
   - Check file size is under 50MB limit
   - Verify PDF is not password-protected or corrupted
